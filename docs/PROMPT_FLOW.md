# üìù Prompt Flow Documentation

This document outlines the prompt design and flow for the Richmond Storyline Generator's conversational story development system.

---

## üéØ Overview

The system uses a multi-stage prompt flow to guide users through story development, from initial voice input to final story generation. Each stage has specific prompts designed to elicit the right information and guide the conversation effectively.

---

## üîÑ Conversation Flow Stages

### Stage 1: Voice Input & Depth Analysis

**Purpose**: Evaluate the depth and potential of the user's initial story idea

**Prompt**: `DEPTH_ANALYSIS_PROMPT`
- Analyzes emotional depth, community relevance, narrative potential, and specificity
- Returns a depth score and classification (SUFFICIENT_DEPTH or INSUFFICIENT_DEPTH)
- Provides reasoning for the assessment

**Example Flow**:
```
User Input: "I want to tell a story about local zoning laws for backyard egg hens"
Analysis: Emotional Depth: 2, Community Relevance: 4, Narrative Potential: 3, Specificity: 2
Result: INSUFFICIENT_DEPTH
```

### Stage 2: Follow-up Questions

**Purpose**: Deepen insufficient story ideas or gather personal anecdotes for sufficient ones

**Prompts**: 
- `FOLLOW_UP_QUESTION_PROMPT` (for insufficient depth)
- `PERSONAL_ANECDOTE_PROMPT` (for sufficient depth)
- `PERSONAL_IMPACT_PROMPT` (for personal connection)

**Example Questions**:
- "For you, why does this story about zoning laws mean something?"
- "What's a quick anecdote where this has appeared in a meaningful way in your life?"

### Stage 3: Enhanced Prompt Generation

## üìã Prompt Template Structure

Each prompt follows this structure:

```python
PROMPT_NAME = """
You are [role/context]

[Specific instructions and requirements]

[Input variables: {variable_name}]

[Expected output format]

[Additional guidance]
"""
```

### Template Variables

Common variables used across prompts:
- `{user_input}` - Original user story idea
- `{story_core}` - Enhanced story core with personal context
- `{richmond_context}` - Retrieved Richmond knowledge base content
- `{selected_hook}` - User-selected story hook
- `{narrative_arc}` - Developed story arc
- `{richmond_quote}` - Generated Richmond quote
- `{selected_cta}` - User-selected call to action
